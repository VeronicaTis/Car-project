                    <p>The Leopard 2A7 main battle tank was developed by
                         German Krauss-Maffei Wegmann in cooperation with 
                         the German Army. It is a proposed upgrade package 
                         for existing MBTs. It was first revealed in 2010. 
                         It is a further development of the Leopard 2A6 MBT. 
                         It includes some subsystems of the Leopard 2 Peace 
                         Support Operation variant. The Leopard 2A7 is intended 
                         for urban warfare, low intensity conflicts, as well as 
                         conventional military operations. Currently it is one 
                         of the best main battle tanks in the world. German 
                         Army plans to upgrade about 50-150 Leopard 2 tanks 
                         to the 2A7 standard. German Army ordered a first batch 
                         of 20 MBTs upgraded from existing German Army Leopard 
                         2A6 tanks. First Leopard 2A7 tanks were delivered 
                         to the German Army in 2014. This tank also received 
                         orders from export customers. In 2011 Germany agreed 
                         to sell more than 200 of these main battle tanks to 
                         Saudi Arabia. In 2013, Qatar ordered 62 of these MBTs.
                          These are known as Leopard 2A7Q. <a href="http://www.military-today.com/tanks/leopard_2a7.htm">Information Source</a></p>
