                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p>The Leopard 2A7+ was first shown to the public during the Eurosatory 2010, featuring the label "Developed by KMW – tested and qualified by German MoD". The Leopard 2A7+ has been tested by the Bundeswehr under the name UrbOp (urban operations).[citation needed]
                        <br><br>
                        The Leopard 2A7+ is designed to operate both in low intensity and high intensity conflicts.[149] The tank's protection has been increased by modular armour; the frontal protection has been improved with a dual-kit on the turret and hull front, while 360° protection against RPGs and mine protection increase the survivability of the tank in urban operations.[149] The modular armour's system components were first used by Canada in Afghanistan.[150] It can fire programmable HE munitions and the turret mounted MG3 has been replaced with a stabilised FLW 200 remotely controlled weapon station. The mobility, sustainability and situational awareness have also been improved.[149]
                        <br><br>
                        In December 2018, Hungary ordered 44 2A7+s, making them the second operator of the improved version, after Qatar
