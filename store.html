                    Tanks are way better than cars. When you get into a crash you wont get hurt if you are in a tank. The other person who crashed into you though, that's
                    a different story. Although you should not even get into a crash because all of the cars are trying to avoid you. You dont ever have to deal with road 
                    raged people anymore. Just point the barrel at the car, not them.
